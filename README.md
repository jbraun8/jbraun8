### Hey, I'm Jeff

If you’re on my GitHub, then you must fit into one of three categories:

1) You’re an employer looking to see if you should hire me
It depends on who you’re looking for. Do you want someone who can take a messy dataset and parse out actionable insights? Do you want someone who takes a holistic approach to data science and considers all the stakeholders every step of the way? Do you want someone well-versed in a wide array of the latest data science tools and algorithms? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then I can certainly be of service.

2) You liked something I did on Kaggle and wound up here
Thanks for reading! I’m assuming you enjoyed it if you wound up here (or maybe you hated it so intensely that you went snooping on my profile to add some fuel to the hate fire you’re building). In either case, feel free to shoot me an e-mail if you have specific feedback

3) Other
Fate and happenstance must have brought you here. Seize the opportunity. We’re all just shooting through an endless void on a space rock anyhow, might as well check out this random dude’s online GitHub repo.
